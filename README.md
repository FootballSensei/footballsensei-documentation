## ✨ Epic Story
FootballSensei is a cutting-edge application that utilizes AI technology to predict the outcome of football matches from the Premier League. Our application leverages various features, including sentiment analysis of pre-match discussions on Reddit and historical data such as team form and past wins. By training a sophisticated AI model on matches from 2000-2020, we can accurately predict the outcomes of matches from the 2021-2022 season and beyond.
